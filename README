SAS Tools

A repository of useful tools for analysing SAS projects.

    - Find all .sas files in a directory tree and copy them all into a single text document
    - Locate all input/output datasets and create:
        - A tree of antecedent datasets that contributed to each datasets   
        - The .sas file in which each dataset was created.
        

To Do:
    Add a function for finding Proc Summary datasteps
    Add a function for locating .sas files references within the code but outside of the directory tree.    
    Wrap all into a GUI
